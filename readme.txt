Real time content analytics dashboard for digital publishers and bloggers

== Description ==

Momently's real-time analytics dashboard is an easy way to evaluate content performance over time - across platforms and devices. Momently content analytics for publishers provides a single, comprehensive view of your readers that can be customized based on your needs and shared with others.

Once you become a [Momently](https://momently.com) member, you can use this plugin to automatically add the tracking code to your WordPress Site. Unlike Google Analytics, you'll instantly see your analytics data after installing the plugin.


**Top Features of Momently Analytics:**

1. Custom reports
2. Intelligent insight reports
3. Attention time, scroll depth and click-through rate
4. Real time dashboard
5. Automatic bot and spam detection
6. Compliant with European GDPR guidelines
7. Unlimited filter and segmentation


**Use cases**

Here are just a small fraction of questions you can answer with Momently?

1. What evergreen contents are still driving traffic to my site? Which one I should update?
    a. Filter by content age (older than 4 weeks),
    b. Set your dashboard time period to "last month"
    c. Set comparison period to previous period or previous year
    d. Set sort metric to view or visitors.
    e. Change sort order to falling
    f. You’ll see a list of posts that you should update or redistributed in your network

2. What channels are bringing high quality engaging traffic to my site?
    a. Breakdown your traffic by referer
    b. Apply behavior filter: "time spent more than 30 seconds"
    c. (Optional) Apply loyalty filter : "loyal and returning"

3. Why visitors are spending less time on my site?
    a. Make sure you get Momently's intelligent daily report. Our servers analyze your data and answer this question on "behavior section of the report."

4. Which segment of my audience is engaging less with my site?
    a. We analyze your data everyday. If we find any anomaly in your traffic or engagement metrics, we append a new section to your daily insight report about it.

5. What articles are trending now on my site and what channels are driving that traffic?
    a. Select last 3 minutes. Optionally you can select last 10 or 30 minutes
    b. Set comparison period to previous period
    c. Apply referrer breakdown
    d. You’ll see which posts, authors or sections are trending now and from what channels


**Analytics Data Segmentation:**

With Momently Analytics you can breakdown your data to analyze a particular subset of data. For example, if you find that loyal readers from a particular geographic region are no longer viewing your sports articles as they normally would (a subset of readers that have been isolated by applying region, loyalty, and sports section filters), you can breakdown your data with referral sources to see whether the decline in viewership is common amongst all loyal sports readers from that specific region or just those from a specific traffic source.

**Real-time Analytics Dashboard:**

Momently Analytics provides both real-time and historical data. You can enable real-time update under dashboard settings in the lower right-hand corner of the screen and the display will switch to real-time. The screen is updated every 10 seconds so that you can act quickly - and surely - when it matters.

Note that even when the real-time option is not enabled, the analytics data is available on your dashboard within seconds after activity is measured on your site.


**Custom Reporting**

Momently Analytics built-in daily, weekly and monthly reports offer virtually unlimited customization. You can create highly customized reports that are easily shareable with your team members.
